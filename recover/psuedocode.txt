So let's bring all these pieces together and make some pseudocode.
First we want to open the memory card file. (done)
Then, repeating until we've reached the end of the card file, (done)
we'll read 512 bytes in.(done)

Then we'll ask whether we're at the start of a new JPEG.
If we are, then we'll ask whether we've already found a JPEG.
If we haven't, then that means that we'll start our very first JPEG.
But if we already have found a JPEG, then that
means that we need to close the previous file and then open our new one.
Now, say we've read 512 bytes in and we haven't
reached the start of a new JPEG.
Well, then we ask ourselves, well, have we already found a JPEG or not?
Because if we haven't, then that means that we can simply
discard those 512 bytes and then go to the start of our loop.
But if we have already found a JPEG, then that
means that those 512 bytes belong to the currently opened file.
Finally, once we've reached the end of the memory card, we can exit the loop
and close any remaining files.
